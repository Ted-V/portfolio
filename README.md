Thanks for reviewing my portfolio. Below are my technical writing samples.

# Guide: Install Ubuntu on a Virtual Machine

[This quick installation guide](https://github.com/Ted-V/portfolio/blob/main/resources/Ubuntu%20VM%20Guide/ubuntu_vm_installation_guide.md) explains how to use Oracle’s VirtualBox software to install Ubuntu Linux on a virtual machine.

**Background:** Virtual machines fascinate me. Early on in my programming education I was advised to set up a virtual machine where I would do all of my coding work. I thought it was neat to have a separate workspace where I could toy around with Linux and not worry so much about breaking my computer. As an aspiring technical writer, I wrote this guide to gain experience working with Markdown and Snag It. The guide is intended to help someone quickly set up a virtual machine without getting bogged down in configuration.

# Summary Report: Test Session on IBM.com

[This report](resources/ibm_exploratory_test_summary.pdf) summarizes an exploratory test session I performed on IBM.com’s UI. The report highlights a defect in their feature that allows potential clients to book sales meetings.

**Background:** In addition to technical writing, I am interested in software testing and quality assurance. I recently passed ISTQB’s foundation level testing exam and have been practicing testing skills on websites to gain some practical experience. I wrote this report as a way to practice both writing and testing skills. I wrote for an expert audience.

**Background:** I created this guide as a way to practice my documentation skills. As someone desiring to become a technical writer, I was advised to try writing documentation for a household item. Following that advice, I searched my home and found an old chess set that was missing a rulebook. This is my novice attempt at creating that missing rulebook.
