Thanks for reviewing my portfolio. Below are my technical writing samples.

# How to Write and Run Test Scripts Using JavaScript and Selenium WebDriver

This [tutorial]() explains how to use JavaScript and Selenium WebDriver to write scripts that automate web browser activity. The tutorial is intended for beginners who have a basic understanding of JavaScript. The tutorial uses an example to teach how to use Selenium methods to locate and interact with HTML elements.

**Background:** I heard Selenium is a popular tool in automation testing so I thought I'd try learning it. To my dismay, I had trouble finding a good tutorial written in JavaScript, the language I'm most familiar with. After learning the basics of Selenium from multiple sources, I decided to write a tutorial of my own. Writing this guide helped me solidify my knowledge and I hope it can help other beginners get started.

# How to Install Ubuntu on a Virtual Machine

This [how-to guide](https://github.com/Ted-V/portfolio/blob/main/resources/Ubuntu%20VM%20Guide/ubuntu_vm_installation_guide.md) explains how to use Oracle’s VirtualBox software to install Ubuntu Linux on a virtual machine. The guide is task-oriented and assumes basic computer literacy.

**Background:** Early on in my programming education I was advised to work on my coding projects inside of a virtual machine. I thought it was neat to have a separate workspace where I could toy around with Linux and not worry about breaking my computer. Looking back, I remember being confused about how to set up the virtual machine. This guide is intended to help someone quickly set up a virtual machine without getting bogged down in configuration. Writing this guide gave me experience working with Markdown and Snag It.

# Game Manual: How to Play Chess

This [game manual](resources/chess_manual.pdf) explains the rules of chess.

<a href="resources/chess_manual.pdf"><img src="resources/thumbnails/chess_manual_graphic.png" style="box-shadow: 1px 1px 1px 1px grey;"/></a>

**Background:** I created this guide as a way to practice my documentation skills. As someone desiring to become a technical writer, I was advised to try writing documentation for a household item. Following that advice, I searched my home and found an old chess set that was missing a rulebook. This is my novice attempt at creating that missing rulebook. 

# Summary Report: Test Session on IBM.com

This [report](resources/ibm_exploratory_test_summary.pdf) summarizes an exploratory test session I performed on IBM.com’s UI. The report highlights a defect in their feature that allows potential clients to book sales meetings.

**Background:** In addition to technical writing, I'm interested in software testing and quality assurance work. I recently passed ISTQB’s foundation exam and I've been practicing my testing skills on various websites to gain practical experience. I wrote this report as a way to practice my writing and testing skills. I wrote for an expert audience.
