Thanks for reviewing my portfolio. Below are my technical writing samples.

# Guide: Installing Ubuntu on a Virtual Machine

[This quick installation guide]() explains how to use Oracle’s VirtualBox software to install Ubuntu Linux on a virtual machine. 

**Background:** Virtual machines fascinate me. Early on in my programming education I was advised to set up a virtual machine where I would do all of my coding work. I thought it was neat to have a separate workspace where I could toy around with Linux and not worry so much about breaking my computer. As an aspiring technical writer, I wrote this guide strictly for experience. The target reader is someone looking to quickly set up a virtual machine without getting bogged down in configuration.


# Summary Report: Exploratory Test Session on IBM.com's UI

[This report]() summarizes an exploratory test session I performed on IBM.com’s UI. The report highlights a defect in their feature that allows potential clients to book sales meetings.

**Background:** In addition to technical writing, I am interested in software testing as a potential career. I recently passed ISTQB’s foundation level testing exam and have been practicing testing skills on websites to help me gain experience. I wrote this report as a way to practice my writing and testing skills. I wrote for an expert audience.


# Game Manual: How to Play Chess

[This game manual]() explains how to play chess to new players. 

The manual covers:
- Pieces
- Board setup
- Special moves
- Win conditions
- Draws

**Background:** I created this guide as a way to practice my documentation skills. As someone desiring to become a technical writer, I was advised to try writing documentation for a household item. Following that advice, I searched my home and found an old chess set that was missing a rulebook. This is my novice attempt at creating that missing rulebook.
